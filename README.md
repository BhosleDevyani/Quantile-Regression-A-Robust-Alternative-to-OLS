# Quantile-Regression-A-Robust-Alternative-to-OLS
Project Background
Quantile regression extends traditional regression analysis by estimating conditional quantiles of the response variable rather than focusing solely on the mean. This method provides a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between predictors and response variables, especially in datasets with heteroscedasticity, outliers, or non-normal error distributions, where classical linear regression assumptions may not hold.

Objectives
Apply quantile regression models to estimate different conditional quantiles (e.g., median, quartiles) to capture diverse aspects of the response distribution.

Compare the performance of quantile regression against ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to highlight differences in model fit and robustness.

Evaluate model diagnostics to ensure validity and interpretability across various quantiles.

Interpret predictor effects at multiple points in the outcome distribution, identifying heterogeneous impacts that are missed by mean regression.

Methodology
Model Development: Constructed both simple and multiple quantile regression models using R programming language and relevant statistical packages.

Diagnostic Analysis: Performed residual analysis and goodness-of-fit checks specific to quantile regression models to verify assumptions and model adequacy.

Visualization: Created plots of quantile regression lines across different quantiles to visually interpret how predictor effects vary throughout the response distribution.

Data Analysis: Focused on datasets exhibiting heteroscedasticity and outliers to demonstrate the advantages of quantile regression over traditional methods.

Key Findings
Heterogeneous Effects: Detected significant variations in predictor influences at different quantiles, revealing patterns obscured by average-based regression techniques.

Robustness: Showed that quantile regression provides stable and reliable estimates even when error variances change or outliers are present in the data.

Enhanced Interpretability: Visual representations of conditional quantile lines offered deeper insights into the response variableâ€™s distribution and the nature of predictor relationships.

Improved Model Fit: Observed better fitting models at extreme quantiles compared to OLS, supporting its use in diverse applied settings.

Conclusion
Quantile regression emerges as a valuable extension to classical linear regression, enabling analysts to capture a fuller picture of predictor-response relationships. It equips researchers and practitioners with nuanced, quantile-specific insights that are critical for decision-making in complex real-world data scenarios.
