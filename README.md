# Quantile-Regression-A-Robust-Alternative-to-OLS
This project explores Quantile Regression as a robust alternative to OLS, handling heteroscedasticity and outliers while capturing variability beyond the mean. Using Engelâ€™s food expenditure and air quality datasets, it is implemented in R (quantreg) and SAS, providing scripts, visualizations, and insights for analyzing diverse data distributions.
