# Quantile-Regression-A-Robust-Alternative-to-OLS

## Project Background
- Quantile regression models different points (quantiles) of the response distribution, providing deeper insights than mean-based regression.
- Particularly useful for datasets with heteroscedasticity, outliers, or non-normal errors where traditional linear regression may fail.

## Objectives
- Apply quantile regression to estimate conditional quantiles beyond the mean.
- Compare quantile regression with classical least squares models using real-world datasets.
- Evaluate model fit and interpret predictor effects across various quantiles.

## Methodology
- Developed simple and multiple quantile regression models using R.
- Conducted diagnostic checks and visualized quantile-specific regression lines.
- Analyzed impacts of heteroscedasticity and outliers through conditional quantile estimates.

## Key Findings
- Identified significant predictor effects at various quantiles not detected by mean regression.
- Demonstrated robustness of quantile regression under non-constant variance and outliers.
- Enhanced interpretation via visualization of conditional quantile trends.
- Observed improved model fit at extreme quantiles compared to classical regression.

## Conclusions
- Quantile regression complements classical regression by delivering nuanced insights across the entire outcome distribution.
- Offers robust, flexible modeling particularly valuable for complex and heterogeneous data.
